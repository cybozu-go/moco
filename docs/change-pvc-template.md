# Change the volumeClaimTemplates

MOCO supports MySQLCluster `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` changes.

When `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` is changed, moco-controller will try to recreate the StatefulSet.
This is because modification of `volumeClaimTemplates` in StatefulSet is currently not allowed.

Re-creation StatefulSet is done with the same behavior as `kubectl delete sts moco-xxx --cascade=orphan`, without removing the working Pod.

> NOTE: It may be possible to edit the StatefulSet directly in the future.

When re-creating a StatefulSet, moco-controller does not support any operation other than volume expansion as described below.
It only re-creates the StatefulSet.
Therefore, changes to the label and annotation assigned to the PVC must be done by the user.
This is because there is a concern that if someone other than the moco-controller is editing the PVC's metadata, there may be side effects.

### Metrics

The success or failure of the re-creating a StatefulSet is notified to the user in the following metrics:

```text
moco_cluster_statefulset_recreate_total{name="mycluster", namespace="mynamesapce"} 3
moco_cluster_statefulset_recreate_errors_total{name="mycluster", namespace="mynamesapce"} 1
```

If a StatefulSet fails to recreate, the metrics in `moco_cluster_statefulset_recreate_errors_total` is incremented after each reconcile,
so users can notice anomalies by monitoring this metrics.

See the [metrics documentation](./metrics.md) for more details.

## Volume expansion

moco-controller automatically resizes the PVC when the size of the MySQLCluster volume claim is extended.
If the volume plugin supports [online file system expansion](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/#online-file-system-expansion),
the PVs used by the Pod will be expanded online.

If volume is to be expanded, `.allowVolumeExpansion` of the StorageClass must be `true`.
moco-controller will validate with the admission webhook and reject the request if volume expansion is not allowed.

If the volume plugin does not support online file system expansion,
the Pod must be restarted for the volume expansion to reflect.
This must be done manually by the user.

When moco-controller resizes a PVC, there may be a discrepancy between the PVC defined in the MySQLCluster and the actual PVC size.
For example, if you are using [github.com/topolvm/pvc-autoresizer](https://github.com/topolvm/pvc-autoresizer).
In this case, moco-controller will only update if the actual PVC size is smaller than the PVC size after the change.

### Metrics

The success or failure of the PVC resizing is notified to the user in the following metrics:

```text
moco_cluster_volume_resized_total{name="mycluster", namespace="mynamesapce"} 4
moco_cluster_volume_resized_errors_total{name="mycluster", namespace="mynamesapce"} 1
```

This metrics is incremented if the volume size change succeeds or fails.
If fails to volume size changed, the metrics in `moco_cluster_volume_resized_errors_total` is incremented after each reconcile,
so users can notice anomalies by monitoring this metrics.

See the [metrics documentation](./metrics.md) for more details.

## Volume reduction

MOCO supports PVC reduction, but unlike PVC expansion, the user must perform the operation manually.

The steps are as follows:

1. The user modifies the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` of the MySQLCluster and sets a smaller volume size.
2. MOCO updates the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` of the StatefulSet. This does not propagate to existing Pods, PVCs, or PVs.
3. The user manually deletes the MySQL Pod & PVC.
4. Wait for the Pod & PVC to be recreated by the statefulset-controller, and for MOCO to clone the data.
5. Once the cluster becomes Healthy, the user deletes the next Pod and PVC.
6. It is completed when all Pods and PVCs are recreated.

### 1. The user modifies the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` of the MySQLCluster and sets a smaller volume size

For example, the user modifies the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` of the MySQLCluster as follows:

```diff
  apiVersion: moco.cybozu.com/v1beta2
  kind: MySQLCluster
  metadata:
    namespace: default
    name: test
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: mysqld
          image: quay.io/cybozu/mysql:8.0.30
    volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: mysql-data
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
-           storage: 1Gi
+           storage: 500Mi
```

### 2. MOCO updates the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` of the StatefulSet. This does not propagate to existing Pods, PVCs, or PVs

The moco-controller will update the `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` of the StatefulSet.
The actual modification of the StatefulSet's `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` is not allowed,
so this change is achieved by recreating the StatefulSet.
At this time, only the recreation of StatefulSet is performed, without deleting the Pods and PVCs.

### 3. The user manually deletes the MySQL Pod & PVC

The user manually deletes the PVC and Pod.
Use the following command to delete them:

```console
$ kubectl delete --wait=false pvc <pvc-name>
$ kubectl delete --grace-period=1 <pod-name>
```

### 4. Wait for the Pod & PVC to be recreated by the statefulset-controller, and for MOCO to clone the data

The statefulset-controller recreates Pods and PVCs, creating a new PVC with a reduced size.
Once the MOCO successfully starts a Pod, it begins cloning the data.

```console
$ kubectl get mysqlcluster,po,pvc
NAME                                AVAILABLE   HEALTHY   PRIMARY   SYNCED REPLICAS   ERRANT REPLICAS   LAST BACKUP
mysqlcluster.moco.cybozu.com/test   True        False     0         2                                   <no value>

persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-data-moco-test-0   Bound    pvc-03c73525-0d6d-49de-b68a-f8af4c4c7faa   1Gi        RWO            standard       2m14s
persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-data-moco-test-1   Bound    pvc-73c26baa-3432-4c85-b5b6-875ffd2456d9   1Gi        RWO            standard       114s

```

### 5. Once the cluster becomes Healthy, the user deletes the next Pod and PVC

The user waits until the MySQLCluster state becomes Healthy, and then deletes the next Pod and PVC.

```console
$ kubectl get mysqlcluster
NAME                                AVAILABLE   HEALTHY   PRIMARY   SYNCED REPLICAS   ERRANT REPLICAS   LAST BACKUP
mysqlcluster.moco.cybozu.com/test   True        True      1         3                                   <no value>
```

### 6. It is completed when all Pods and PVCs are recreated

Repeat steps 3 to 5 until all Pods and PVCs are recreated.
