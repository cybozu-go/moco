## Running tests

MOCO has the following 4 kinds of tests:

1. Tests that do not depend on MySQL or Kubernetes
2. `pkg/dbop` and `pkg/bkop` tests that depend on MySQL version
3. Tests that depend on Kubernetes and therefore run by `controller-runtime`'s [envtest][envtest]
4. End-to-end tests

To run these tests, use the following make targets respectively:

1. `make test`
2. `make test-dbop test-bkop`
3. `make envtest`
4. Read [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md)

MOCO supports multiple MySQL versions.
The three MySQL versions always used by CI are Cybozu internal use version, the latest, and one version before the latest.
Other supported MySQL versions will be [tested only in Weekly](.github/workflows/weekly.yaml).

## Generated files

Some files in the repository are auto-generated.

- `docs/crd_*.md` are generated by `make apidoc`.
- Some files under `config` are generated by `make manifests`.
- `api/**/*.deepcopy.go` are generated by `make generate`.

CI checks and fails if they need to be rebuilt.

## Testing with unreleased moco-agent

MOCO depends on [moco-agent][] that is released from a different repository.
The dependency is therefore managed in `go.mod` file.

To run e2e tests with an unreleased moco-agent, follow the instructions in
[`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md).

In case you need to use the new API set of unreleased moco-agent, use
[`replace`](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-file-replace) directive in `go.mod`
to reference the local source code.

## Updating MySQL binaries in moco-backup

Edit the following lines in `Dockerfile`:

```
# The tag should be the latest one
FROM quay.io/cybozu/mysql:8.0.30.1 as mysql

# See the below description for how to get the version string.
ARG MYSQLSH_VERSION=8.0.30-1
```

The MySQL shell debian package can be found in https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/ .

1. Choose "Ubuntu Linux"
2. Choose `mysql-shell_*ubuntu*_amd64.deb` (not a `dbgsym` image) and click "Download" button.
3. Copy the URL from the link whose text reads `No thanks, just start my download.`.
4. Update `MYSQLSH_VERSION` in `Dockerfile`.

## Updating tools used for tests

Edit [`Makefile`](Makefile) and [`e2e/Makefile`](e2e/Makefile).
Tool versions are defined at the top of them.

## Adding or dropping supported software versions

Edit matrix strategies in [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml).
Also, don't forget to update [`README.md`](README.md).

MySQL versions appear twice:

```yaml
  dbtest:
    name: Integration tests with MySQL
    strategy:
      matrix:
        mysql-version: ["8.0.18", "8.0.25", "8.0.26", "8.0.27", "8.0.28", "8.0.30"]
...
  # Matrix tests for the latest MySQL version on different Kubernetes versions.
  e2e:
    name: Supported Kubernetes versions End-to-End Tests
    strategy:
      matrix:
        mysql-version: ["8.0.30"]
        k8s-version: ["1.19.11", "1.20.7", "1.21.1"]
...
  # Matrix tests for different MySQL versions on the latest supported Kubernetes version.
  e2e-mysql:
    name: Supported MySQL versions End-to-End Tests
    strategy:
      matrix:
        mysql-version: ["8.0.18", "8.0.25", "8.0.26", "8.0.27", "8.0.28", "8.0.30"]
        k8s-version: ["1.21.1"]
```

## Updating moco-agent

Run `go get github.com/cybozu-go/moco-agent@latest`.

## Updating fluent-bit

Edit `FluentBitImage` in [`version.go`](version.go).

## Updating mysqld_exporter

Edit `ExporterImage` in [`version.go`](version.go).
