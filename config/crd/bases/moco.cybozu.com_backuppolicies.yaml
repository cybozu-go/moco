                                              UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                                              don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                                              intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

                      WorkVolume is the volume source for the working directory.
                      Since the backup or restore task can use a lot of bytes in the working directory,
                      You should always give a volume with enough capacity.

                      The recommended volume source is a generic ephemeral volume.
